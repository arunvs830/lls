The existing approach to language education management remains largely manual, fragmented, and unstructured, particularly in institutions that rely on traditional methods of teaching and administration. Different tools are often employed for isolated purposes—such as spreadsheets for maintaining student data, emails for assignment distribution, and manual grading for performance evaluation. This lack of integration results in inefficient workflows, increased administrative overhead, and a higher likelihood of human error.
The decentralized nature of these tools often leads to delayed feedback, inconsistent access to learning materials, and difficulty in tracking student performance over time. Teachers frequently face challenges in monitoring student engagement and progress due to the absence of real-time data and analytics. Furthermore, manual processes for registration, attendance tracking, and payment management are time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale.
Students in traditional systems encounter several issues, such as limited accessibility to updated resources, unclear assignment submission procedures, and delays in receiving evaluation results. The lack of an automated feedback mechanism diminishes opportunities for timely academic improvement. In addition, parental involvement is often minimal, as there are no structured means for parents to track student progress or communicate effectively with instructors.
Administrators face similar challenges in ensuring uniform course delivery, managing user data, and evaluating teaching outcomes. The absence of a centralized and automated platform restricts their ability to maintain system-wide transparency and efficiency.
Overall, the current system suffers from a lack of integration, automation, and real-time monitoring capabilities, which hampers effective communication among students, instructors, parents, and administrators. These shortcomings underscore the urgent need for a comprehensive digital solution—such as the proposed Language Learning System—to streamline educational management, enhance accessibility, and foster a more efficient and collaborative learning environment.

3.2. DATA FLOW DIAGRAM

A data flow diagram is graphical tool used to describe and analyze movement of data through a system. These are central tool and the basis from which the other components are developed. The transformation of data from input to output, trough processed, may be described logically and independently of physical components associated with the system. These are known as the logical data flow movement of data between people, departments and workstations. A full description of a system actually consists of a set of data flow diagrams.

A DFD is also known as a "bubble chart" has the purpose of clarifying system requirements and identifying major transformations that will become programs in system design. So it is the starting point of the design to the lowest level of detail. A DFD consists of a series of bubbles joined by data flows in the system.

In the DFD, there are four symbols


                                             Process that transforms data flow



                                             Source or Destination of data


                                             Data store


                                                   Data flow
Rules for drawing data flow diagrams

Rule 1: Establish the context of the data flow diagram by identifying all of the net input and output data flows.

Rule 2: Select a starting point for drawing the DFD.

Rule 3: Give meaningful labels to all data flow lines.

Rule 4: Label all processes with action verbs that relate input and output data flows.

Rule 5: Omit insignificant functions routinely handled in the programming process.

Rule 6: Do not include control or flow of control information.

Rule 7: Do not try to put too much information in one DFD.

Rule 8: Be prepared to start over.
